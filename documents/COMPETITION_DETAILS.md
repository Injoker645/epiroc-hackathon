## Deciding What To Build & Presentation

### Key Questions to Address

1. **Business case** (30 seconds)
   - Which activity does your solution help the user perform much better?
   - Is this activity mission-critical?

2. **Demo** (3 minutes)
   - What functionality will help the user perform this activity much better, faster, cheaper?
   - Walk through how the user will interact with your solution to achieve the activity

3. **Future development** (30 seconds)
   - What will the future look like if your prototype was further developed and put into production?

4. **Takeaways** (30 seconds)
   - What worked well, what didn't and why?
   - What are your main takeaways?

### Scope It Down
- You have very limited time in a hackathon both for building and for the presentation
- Build only one of the most interesting parts of a complete solution
- You won't have time to demo more than that anyway
- Great to present your idea for the complete solution and then say that you will now demo the most interesting part
